Tracking ways I'm currently wresting control of my digital identity back from the Axis of Evil (MAAMA, a.k.a. Microsoft Amazon Apple Meta & Alphabet):


1. Messenger & WhatsApp -> üìß[Signal](https://signal.org/)
2. Goodreads -> üìö[Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/)
3. Twitter -> üêò[Mastadon](https://mastodonservers.net/)
4. GMail -> ‚öõÔ∏è[Proton Mail](https://proton.me/)
5. ‚ùå Delete Instagram
6. ‚ùå Delete All Personal Data on Google Drive/Mail/Docs

I'll add more to this, probably personal justifications, as I have time.  
For right now, my ranking trust for services is:

1. Federated or completely decentralized (e.g. blockchain, email, bbs)
2. Non-profit organizations with a mission statement & public accountability
3. For-profit corporations, chartered & with data storage in the Europian Union
4. For-profit corporations, chartered & with data storage in the US State of California
5. Everything else
